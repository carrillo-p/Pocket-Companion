The subgame won't have seen Approach if you cast it in a higher level game.\n\n>723.1b No effects or definitions created in either the main game or the subgame have any meaning in the other, except as defined by the effect that created the subgame. For example, the effect may say that something happens in the main game to the winner or loser of the subgame.\n\nBy this rule you also cannot interact with the games above the current one unless your card specifically says so (references \"the main game\") or references \"outside of the game\" - which where the games above the current one reside.\n\nEDIT: Also if you Approach-win in a subgame you only win that subgame. You don't win the main game.\n\nNow for the fuzzy part I'm not entirely sure about:\n\nAssuming Wizened Arbiter would literally swap places of two cards - i.e. a card from your subgame hand ends up on the stack and this exchange can't be interacted with until the game above continues. The exchanged card has never been declared as being cast so you won't get any on-cast triggers. The interesting question is what would happen if a land is exchanged onto the stack that way since playing a land does not use the stack at all.\n\nAlso a set of difficult questions: if Shahrazad on the stack has partially resolved but not fully (= i.e. you're in the subgame) from what point onwards do you start resolving the swapped card? From the beginning? From the middle? Do we assume it has resolved? Where will the new card go? ~~Will Shahrazad's effect of losing life resolve even though it's not on the stack anymore? Does the game remember what used to be on the stack?~~ *Yes it will resolve fully. See comment below and rule quoted in the original post.*\n\nAfter all this I think the more correct answer is that the Arbiter will pull Shahrazad from the stack but places the other card from the subgame to \"outside of game\" where it can no longer be interacted in the game above by normal means. You'd need another wish. \"Outside of game\" is not a zone and should always be common to all games of Magic, in that sense.\n\n~~Even then we run into the problem that you had a spell that tried to resolve but the stack is now 'empty'. Does the game remember it was supposed to resolve Shahrazad's lose life line or is that gone now? Will the game continue as if a spell had just resolved even though nothing changes zones?~~ *See above. And below. And behind you.*",

        "text": "Hello, this is a question regarding an interaction I had with another player during a modern tournament this past FNM. For context I play Infect.\n\nIt was my turn, I had a Noble Hierarch and a Glistener Elf on the battle field. During my main phase and at sorcery speed, I cast Scale Up on Glistener Elf, making his base power and toughness equal to 6/4. I then stated that I was going to attacks. I waited for my opponent to state if they had a response after I went into attacks. I always ask this because if a player does not have a response, I then play spells at instant speed one at a time to see if they have a response each time. Just to make sure my last pump spell resolves on the stack. I out loud counted the damage up after the pump spell I played while attacking and on the stack. I counted out loud +6 for Scale Up, +2 (might have been mutagenic growth, but I forget specifically. It was a +2/+2 pump though.). I then said for a total of 9 with the exalted trigger.\n\nThis is where the question comes in. At this stage, I have declared that I was in attacks, stated that the damage would be for 9 infect, and that for 1 of those damage it was because of my exalted trigger off of Noble Hiearch. However, during all of this, at no point did I ever tap Glistener Elf. I had only stated that I was going to attacks, asked for a response after my attacks, after no response played an additional pump spell on the stack, and then recounted all of my damage to make sure it was for 9 infect counters due to the exalted trigger. I then stated rather quickly that I pass the turn because it wasn't for lethal and my opponent didn't have a response to any of that prior, so I assumed he and I both knew without a question that 9 infect was coming through.\n\nSo the issue is I never tapped Glistener Elf, and although I declared I was in attacks and had the exalted trigger, which only procs if your one and only other creature on the battle field is attacking a player alone, it was stated that I technically passed the turn without tapping Glistener Elf which means all I did was pump him up during attacks but I didn't actually attack him so he wouldn't have taken any damage at all.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly with the player that although I didn't tap GE that he knew exactly what I was doing and in fact I was specifically attacking with GE. I was in attacks, counted the damage up to 9, stated that one of those +1 specifically came from NH's exalted trigger, that I did declare attacks and that it would be lethal for him. My opponent allowed me to play it back and continue with the 9 infect for the win on that game though.\n\nHowever I would like to know your thoughts on this. I believe that if I did this same scenario at a tournament other than FNM and a player didn't let me play it back, that I would have a valid reason that I in fact did attack him specifically with GE simply by the fact that I stated I was going to attack phase, asked for an initial response to any declared attackers, after no response pumped it up further, stated the exalted trigger, and then said for a total of 9. I simply passed the turn right after that with no response from my opponent.\n\nI will answer any questions as best I can. I also intend to show this thread to my opponent for clarity for both of our sake's. For context, I had allowed my opponent to play back a misstep the previous game, which pushed us to game 3, causing this argument. I am very close with my opponent and this has become a major talking point for us. Although it was brought up as a joke that I technically didn't tap GE, I want to feel my win was going to happen anyways without my opponent thinking he lost only because he allowed me to play it back.\n\nThank you very much.",

When casting an adventurer card as an Adventure, only the alternative characteristics are evaluated to see if it can be cast.    \n- 601.3e. Some rules and effects state that an alternative set of characteristics or a subset of characteristics are considered to determine if a card or copy of a card is legal to cast. These alternative characteristics replace the object's characteristics for this determination. Continuous effects that would apply to that object once it has those characteristics are also considered.  \n  \n> my confusion is why past in flames does not allow this interaction  \n  \nBoth Lier and Wrenn & Six use a static ability which isn't locked in on the set of objects that they affect whereas the objects affected by Past in Flames checks once, as it resolves and applies the continuous effect. In the same way, Past in Flames won't affect instants or sorceries that enter the yard after it resolves whereas they would be affected by Lier or Wrenn & Six.    \n  \n- 611.2. A continuous effect may be generated by the resolution of a spell or ability.  \n- 611.2c. If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects, the set of objects it affects is determined when that continuous effect begins. After that point, the set won't change. [..]  \n- 611.3. A continuous effect may be generated by the static ability of an object.  \n- 611.3a.

I proceed to go my to combat phase and after I declare attackers (attacking with my flyers) my opponent goes 'I do have a card that gives all my creatures reach'.\n\nThey gave a truthful answer to the question you asked. A truthful answer is never going to be cheating. It's not their fault you didn't ask a better question.\n\n-----------\n\nThe magic tournament rules define 4 type of information: \n\n - Status information. This is things like a player's life total, or the amount of unspent mana in your mana pool. These things must be proactively announced when they change.\n - Free information. This is things like the details of any past or present game actions that affect the current game state, or what step/phase the game is in. Everyone is entitled to this information, so if you are asked, you must give a truthful answer.\n- Derived information. This is information everyone's allowed to know, but it may require some skill to compute. For example, whether or not creature X has reach based on the continuous effects currently on the table, or what the rules are which govern the declaration of blockers. If you are asked about derived information you can choose to not answer. But if you do answer, you must do so truthfully.\n- Private information is things like the identity of a card in your hand. You do not have to answer these questions, and if you do you can lie.\n\nAlso noteworthy: at regular rules enforcement level, all derived information is automatically free information.\n\nFor more information see section 4 of the [magic tournament rules](https://media.wizards.com/ContentResources/WPN/MTG_MTR_2024_Dec16_EN.pdf)\n\n-----------\n\nSo back to your scenario. Asking \"do you have any flyers\" is asking a question about derived information. They don't have to answer that. If they choose to answer though, they need to give a truthful answer. From your description, none of their creatures had the flying keyword, so \"no\" is correct. \n\nIf you had asked \"do you have any creatures that can block flyers\", then \"no\" would be incorrect, and thus not allowed (though as before, they can just decline to answer). If they lied and said \"no\", then in a competitive event this could result either in a penalty for Communication Policy Violation, or in egregious cases Cheating.",

To summarize, OP said their opponent played gitaxian probe, then physically took their cards and revealed them to the entire table in a multiplayer game. Everyone in the thread except the mod agrees that this is not legal. The two rules the mod cited to say that it is not necessarily, technically against the rules are:\n\n> CR: 701.16d Some effects instruct a player to look at one or more cards. Looking at a card follows the same rules as revealing a card, except that the card is shown only to the specified player.\n\nand \n\n> MTR Section 3.13, Hidden Information: Throughout the match, a draft, and pregame procedures, players are responsible for keeping their cards above the level of the playing surface and for making reasonable efforts to prevent hidden information from being revealed. **However, players may choose to reveal their hands or any other hidden information available to them, unless specifically prohibited by the rules.** Players must not actively attempt to gain information hidden from them but are not required to inform opponents who are accidentally revealing hidden information.\n\n(emphasis theirs)\n\nIt seems to me that both of those rules pretty clearly answer the question. For 701.16d, only the git probe player sees the cards, not everyone else. For 3.13 on hidden information, it says a player can reveal their hand or hidden information that is available to them. Are the OP's cards part of the git probe player's hand? No. Are OP's physical cards themselves \"hidden information available to them?\" No. The information about the cards is hidden information, but the cards themselves are physical cards. The git probe player can state what the cards are for the table, but they can't physically show them. It might just be that the applicable rule is something about conduct and not handling other player's cards.\n\nIs there consensus among judges for this? Is there a rule in the sections on conduct saying anything about physically handling another player's cards if they don't want you to that might apply here? \n\nMaybe most importantly and to the point, how would you handle it at a tournament if someone played git probe against me, tried to physically take my cards out of my hand to show them to the table, I refused, and we called a judge over? \n\nThanks for the help!\n\nedit: added a little clarity",

Players do not get priority to cast things in between the steps of casting a spell, so it cannot be activated to pay costs DURING the casting of a spell.\n\nWhat you CAN do is cast a spell like demonic tutor (paying for it with a different mana source), hold priority, and then activate LED.  You would first discard your hand and sacrifice LED as the cost of activating the ability. The mana goes into your mana pool. Demonic tutor resolves letting you search for a card. You are now free to use that mana on the card in your hand you just tutored for. \n\nHope this helps!",

        "text": "Hey there!\n\nI've decided to start looking into layers and dependencies in my quest to understand how and why Ashaya and Ambush Commander work with each other. My gut instinct, when looking at the rules for dependencies, is that Ambush Commander is dependent on Ashaya, but there seems to be more to it than that.\n\nFor starters, neither \"Forests you control are 1/1 green elf creatures that are still lands\" nor \" Nontoken creatures you control are Forest lands in addition to their other types\" are CDAs, and both effects are applied on Layer 4. Furthermore, it's quite obvious that applying one effect would change the other. In this case, Ashaya's effect making your creatures into Forests would change how many forests exist for Ambush Commander to turn into 1/1 elves.\n\nAnd at first blush, it feels like that's that. Commander is dependent on Ashaya, so their effects apply in dependency order: Ashaya's first, then Ambush Commander, regardless of the order played.\n\nBut the thing that's tripping me up is that even though the board state will never reflect this, Ashaya also seems dependent on Commander. If Commander is making all of your forests into 1/1 elves, they are nontoken creatures that are now affected by Ashaya's ability, making them all into Forest Lands.\n\nSo my question is this: does it matter that they already necessarily had to be Forest Lands in order to become Elves? Is this technically a dependency loop, and if so, does that mean the effects apply in timestamp order rather than dependency order?",

I cast Exsanguiante by paying one colorless and two swamps, as soon as I pay the casting cost the spell is removed from my hand and added to the stack. At this point the spell is officialy \"Cast\" and a second copy of the spell goes on the stack BEFORE PRIORITY CHANGES. Once my spell and the copy are on the stack my opponents now get priority and my friend casts Naturalize, targeting Unbound Flourishing for destruction. At this point the stack resolves as there are no more additions. Naturalize resolves first and destroys Unbound Flourishing, my initial cast of Exsanguinate drains one life from each opponent and then finally my copy of Exsanguinate drains one life from each opponent (despite Unbound Flourishing being destroyed first, both copies were added to the stack at the time of the CAST).   \n\n\nIs this correct?

The application of continuous effects as described by the layer system is **continually** and automatically performed by the game. All resulting changes to an object's characteristics are instantaneous.    \n- 611.3c. **Continuous effects that modify characteristics of permanents do so simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield.

        "text": "Hello! I have a scenario and question about passing priority in a multiplayer game:\n\nAlice is the active player; turn order is Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave\n\n1. Alice casts Wrath of God, and passes priority to Bob\n2. Bob takes no response and passes priority\n3. Charlie casts Counterspell, targeting Wrath of God\n\nFrom here, where does priority go?  I thought priority always proceeded in turn order, which would mean Dave gets first priority on the Counterspell, but recently I was told that after a non-active player takes an action, priority always passes to the active player.  This means Alice gets priority after Counterspell goes on the stack (assuming Charlie did not hold priority after he casts his Counterspell) and then priority goes in turn order.\n\nThis would mean that the following is a correct way to play out the full scenario:\n\n1. Alice casts Wrath of God, and passes priority to Bob\n2. Bob has no response and passes priority\n3. Charlie casts Counterspell, targeting Wrath of God, and does not hold priority\n4. Alice gets priority again, passes with no response to Counterspell\n5. Bob passes priority\n6. Charlie regains priority, and passes\n7. Dave gets priority for the first time:\n\n* If Dave passes priority on Counterspell, Counterspell resolves, and Wrath of God is countered\n* If Dave responds to Counterspell in any way, repeat from step 4 onward for his spell or ability, with a full cycle of passing priority for each spell/ability\n\nIs all of the above correct?  It feels weird that Charlie would gain priority a second time for his own spell (once, when he first casts it if he had held priority, then again after Bob passes to him) before Dave gets priority on that Counterspell?\n\nPriority is weird man.

If any mana is in that player’s mana pool, they announce what mana is there. **Then the next player in turn order receives priority.**\n\nWhoever told you that might have confused it with what happens when something *resolves*.\n\n>117.3b The active player receives priority after a spell or ability (other than a mana ability) **resolves**.\r\n\nThe actual sequence would look like this:\n\n1. Alice's main phase begins.\n2. Alice gets priority and casts Wrath of God.  Alice pays the cost using mana obtained in an unspecified way.\n3. Alice gets priority and passes.\n4. Bob gets priority and passes.\n5. Charlie gets priority and casts Counterspell.  Charlie chooses Wrath of God as the target and pays the cost using mana obtained in an unspecified way.\n6. Charlie gets priority and passes.\n7. Dave gets priority and passes.\n8. Alice gets priority and passes.\n9. Bob gets priority and passes.\n10.

I have seen 2 interpretations of the ability. \n\n1. *That much damage* refers to the value of the six-sided die rolled.\n2. *That much damage* refers to the amount of damage dealt when triggering Crash Land\n\nOption 1 seems to be the more common and balanced interpretation.

        "title": "WEREWOLF DECK INTERACTION QUESTIONS",
        "text": "I had posted a similar question in another subreddit and they sent me here because I'd have more luck getting an answer so here I am! I had posted the following:\n\nSo I've been trying to wrap my head around this day//night cycle stuff but it just doesn't click with me yet. I just wanted some clarification on a few interactions that I've been thinking about and I wanted to make sure I was using this mechanic correctly:\n\n1. So first interaction I want to get out of the way is Immerwolf and Tovolar. Immerwolf doesn't allow your werewolves to transform back into humans right? So if I have Tovolar out on the field with Immerwolf and another wolf/werewolf and on my upkeep Tovolar transforms, does he stay that way? The reason I ask is because Tovolar's human side gives me the ability to transform my humans into werewolves. If he is always stuck on his werewolf side, does that mean I essentially locked myself out of one of the easier ways to transform my werewolves? If that's the case then when would it be safe to play immerwolf? Should I wait until I have more werewolves on the field before using it? Because I feel that if youre gonna make a werewolf deck, immerwolf is essential if I'm gonna be including some of the older werewolves in my deck.\n\n2. The second interaction I was thinking about is cult of the waxing moon and getting some wolf tokens out onto the field. Let's say I have that card on my field plus my three werewolves (one being Tovolar). I pass my turn to my opponent while it is night. My opponent then plays his two spells to turn it into day for my turn. When it passes to me it becomes day so my werewolves for a brief moment become human but because of Tovolar, on my upkeep, it becomes night again and therefore they transform back into werewolves. The cult of the waxing moon should theoretically activate and thus create a total of 3 wolves on my field. Is this a correct conclusion to come to? \n\n3. I know that moonmist doesn't work (or does it? I'll get back to that in a second) on the new Daybound//Nightbound werewolves but I did want someone's opinion on whether this would still be a nice addition to a deck anyways. I understand this one for the most part, but It's nice to know what to do with this card from a deckbuilding standpoint.\n\n3a. This is kind of a combo I've been thinking about with moonmist but sounds like it might be janky so I'm not sure if it will even work this way, but I wanna put everything out there to ease my mind. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I read somewhere that apparently the reason why moonmist doesn't work on the new werewolves is because moonmist WILL transform them, it's just that because they are Daybound and it is DAY they will immediately transform back making the interaction pretty much useless. BUT I had the idea of using a combination of immerwolf and moonmist with the new werewolves (this idea is really only for when I can't bring out Tovolar for some unknown reason). So let's assume it's day on my turn. Immerwolf is already in play and I have some daybound werewolves on the field. I then use moonmist to transform them into werewolves. They are daybound so they are forced to transform back because it is still day, but because immerwolf is on the field already, they get locked in their werewolf state thus making the moonmist interaction go through. Does this interaction allow moonmist to \"semi-work\" on the new werewolves then?\n\n3b. Another wierd combo that i thought MIGHT work (assuming I use the same rationale from 2. and 3a.) Is cult of the waxing moon, and some daybound werewolves used in conjunction with moonmist. So let's say I use moonmist to transform the werewolves while cult of the waxing moon is in play. They transform for a brief moment but transform back because it is still day and they are daybound. Would it still trigger Cult of the waxing moon and create wolf tokens anyways? This combo feels like an unnecessary use of that card but I guess in a pinch you can make yourself some wolf tokens (if it indeed works the way I think it does).\n\n4. This one is a bit of a doozy for me and is a little tricky cuz I'm not sure if it's classified as an Immerwolf or a Moonmist type of card and that is Geier Reach Bandit. It's front is simple enough but the back is where it confuses me. When it's on its werewolf side the card states \"Whenever a Werewolf enters the battlefield under your control you may transform it.\" I'm leaning more to it being like moonmist in that it doesn't work but I could be wrong. I've only seen mention of moonmist and not this one so I'd like to know how you guys would classify this card.\n\n4a. Now assuming Geier Reach Bandit works like moonmist, can I use the same theory that I used in 3a. and apply it to this? So Immerwolf and Geier are on the field, i cast a daybound creature, Geier transforms them and Immerwolf locks them before their daybound restriction can activate? Would this interaction also work?\n\n5. This one isn't really about the day//night cycle it's more a question on a specific ability on Full Moon's Rise. This one has mention of a regeneration ability that also confuses me to no end. What exactly does regeneration do? Does it protect me from board wipes the way abilities like hexproof, shroud, and indestructible possibly do? \n\n5a. Assuming it works in a way like indestructible I wanted to know how it would work in this certain scenario. Let's say I have a 1/1 creature that is being currently boosted by Full Moon's Rise and given trample; making it essentially a 2/1 creature with trample. My opponent then blocks me with a 1/1 creature. Before the combat damage is dealt, I decide to Sacrifice my Full Moon's Rise to regenerate my creature. Does the extra 1 damage go through? Or because Full Moon's Rise is sacrificed before the damage is dealt, I lose trample  and the only thing I end up accomplishing is destroying their creature and having my creature survive that attack? This leads me to the next part:\n\n5b. Let's assume that apart from having Full Moon's Rise in play, I had another card on the field giving trample. Say Howlpack Resurgence for instance. I have a 1/1 creature on the field that is now a 3/2. My opponent decides to block with 2/1 creature. Before damage is dealt I decide to sacrifice Full Moon's Rise to regenerate my creature. I still keep trample due to the other card I have in play. So in my head, the sequence would be: the creatures clash, the 1 damage goes through due to trample, they both die, but because I sacrificed Full Moon's Rise beforehand, my creature ends up surviving the interaction. Is it safe to assume that this is correct? \n\n6. This is the last one I promise! I wanted some clarification on the card In search of greatness? I was a bit confused as to what it does but from what I gather is this: I have In search of greatness on the field and I have a permanent on the field with a mana cost of 5. In search of greatness would allow me to play a permanent with a mana cost of 6 for free? The last part of the card says \"If you don't, scry 1\". Does that mean I can choose whether or not I want to play a permanent? So I have two interaction I can choose from?\n\nI'm sorry this is so long but Im a beginner and I want to play with some friends but I also don't want to go in making mistakes and slowing down the gameplay for everyone else. I feel like playing a Werewolf deck as a beginner is probably the worst thing I could have done for myself but I really enjoy the theme and I had to go for it lol. I also apologize for any and all misspellings. I'm writing this all out during a sleepless night and these questions have been constantly nagging me to the point that I just HAD to go on Reddit and get me some answers xD",

Destroy happens three ways: lethal damage for creatures (state-based action), damage from a source with Deathtouch for creatures (state-based action), an effect that says destroy. It doesn't work on anything else (eg. sacrifice, legend rule, planeswalker at 0 loyalty, etc.)    \n  \n> Does it protect me from board wipes the way abilities like hexproof, shroud, and indestructible possibly do?  \n  \nHexproof and Shroud don't help unless the board wipe specifically targets them (and most don't).  \nIndestructible and Regenerate are different, but Regenerate is more similar to Indestructible than to Hexproof or Shroud.    \n  \nSome board wipes indicate things \"can't be regenerated\" (eg. Wrath of God) so wouldn't be helpful against it (unlike Indestructible)  \nAlso, Regenerate acts like a single use shield and only works for the turn it is applied until it is used.    \n  \n> Does the extra 1 damage go through?  \n  \nNo, your werewolf will be a 1/1 without Trample in the damage step. \nWhen the FMR activation resolves, it puts a regeneration shield on your werewolf creatures, that shield will last on each werewolf until the turn ends or it gets used whichever comes first.  \nYour werewolves will deal damage normally (no buff, no trample) and then right after all damage is dealt, the game sends out the state-based actions to cleanup the game state and it sees your 1/1 with 1 marked damage on it (which is lethal) and attempts to destroy it, however, this is where the regeneration shield steps in and does its thing, it replaces the destroy action with three alternative actions: it removes the 1 marked damage (taking away the lethal damage so the state-based actions will ignore it on next check), it removes it from combat (but it already dealt damage so not really relevant here, though it could matter if someone hit your attacking 2/1 with Doom Blade before the damage step) and it attempts to tap it (which most likely fails here unless your 1/1 had Vigilance).  \n  \n> the only thing I end up accomplishing is destroying their creature and having my creature survive that attack?  \n  \nYep.  \n  \n> Does that mean I can choose whether or not I want to play a permanent?  \n  \nCorrect, you may cast a non-instant, non-sorcery spell with a mana value of exactly 6 for (0) or scry 1, your choice.",

Let me elaborate on two situations that are unclear to me.\n\nSuppose I have a sylvan library in play. At the beginning of my draw step the library triggers and before resolving its trigger I cast a brainstorm. As per the sylvan library's ruling \n\n> Any cards drawn prior to Sylvan Library’s ability resolving, including in your upkeep or in response to Sylvan Library’s triggered ability, can be chosen to be put back using this effect. Sylvan Library’s controller is responsible for keeping these cards distinguishable in hand, such as by keeping them separate from cards that began the turn in hand. \n\nSo I make sure to keep the cards  drawn by brainstorm separate in my hand and make it clear to my opponent whether the cards  I'm putting back on top of the deck are among the cards drawn with brainstorm or not. First of all is this the correct way of resolving a brainstorm in response to a sylvan library's trigger? \n\nNow suppose that I choose to put back on top of my deck two of the cards drawn with brainstorm and, before the on stack trigger of sylvan library resolves, I cast a demonic tutor (at istant speed through some other effect which is not relevant to the question) and make it clear to my opponent that I'm putting the top  card of my deck into my hand with the tutor and it keep it separated from the rest of my hand. Finally I let the the sylvan library's trigger resolve and draw two cards, which I also keep separated. Having kept them separated I now have four cards in my hand recognizable to my opponent as a card drawn by brainstorm, two cards drawn by sylvan  library and a card drawn by brainstorm, put back on top of my deck by brainstorm and then put into my hand by a demonic tutor. Is the latter a \"card in my hand drawn this turn\"? That is do I have three or four cards in my hand that I can choose to put back through the sylvan library's effect?\n\nWhat happens if in between the brainstorm and the demonic tutor I also fetch or use another suffle effect, am I supposed to keep track of which cards in my deck have been \"drawn this turn\" somehow just in case they are put into my hand before the sylvan library's trigger resolves?",

This interaction popped up in a Michael Cellani article today ([How They Brew It - Dan Lewis Hits You with a Car](https://commandersherald.com/how-they-brew-it-dan-lewis-hits-you-with-a-car/)) and I assume it works and think I got the rules to justify it, but I'm still not 100% sure. Here's the way to get to the interaction :\n\nStart with \\[\\[Spellweaver Volute\\]\\] enchanting an instant in the graveyard. Play \\[\\[Dan Lewis\\]\\] and \\[\\[Captain Rex Nebula\\]\\]. Go to combat. Rex Nebula triggers, targeting Spellweaver Volute, turning it in a Vehicle artifact 5/5 until the end of turn, which also makes it an equipment with Equip {1} because of Dan Lewis. Main phase 2, equip Spellweaver Volute to a creature and cast a sorcery. This is where the truly weird things start :\n\nFirst, I think that rule 303.4b (aura) means Spellweaver Volute's \"copy the enchanted instant card\" means \"copy the object this is attached to\" and it effectively becomes \"copy the equipped creature\". This, I think I understand, it doesn't have an \"if\" clause nor does it target the enchanted creature, therefore it doesn't check the type of the object it's enchanting and it works.\n\nSecond, once we get to creating the clone, I can't find the right rule for this. Looking through the 706 rules, not a single one of them talks about creating a clone of a permanent without casting it, 706.12 seems like the one that should be applied, meaning the token is created on the same zone as the object it's copying, the battlefield. The thing that makes me questions this is that this rule talks about effects \"that instructs a player to cast a copy of an object\", and at this point Spellweaver Volute has yet to do this, I'm guessing because of rules 608.2c we have to \"apply the rules of English to the text\" and consider that Spellweaver Volute will be instructing us to cast the copy ?\n\nThird, assuming I've got the right rule or at least the right logic, the copy is a token, created on the battlefield, and we now are faced with a choice, we may play our copy. If we decide to do, it's moved from the battlefield to the stack, and after this the Spellweaver Volute resolves normally, exiling the original and attaching itself to an instant in a graveyard. If we refuse to, as it's a permanent and no effect instructs us to move it to another zone, nothing happens and the Spellweaver Volute finishes resolving without exiling the original as we didn't cast the copy. Then in both cases the ETB and relevant effects are triggered and so on, the game continues normally.\n\nAm I right ? This is a very weird interaction, I'm really not sure I'm understanding the rules well or managed to confused myself.",

Though I'm mostly still thinking about it because I got yelled at by a grown man about a card game that didn't matter for reasons I will enumerate on. \n\nI help run my local stores Magic events, they are not WPN and the owner is more into the other aspects of gaming/collectables. I run the companion app for bracketing and act as a \"judge\" to look up and answer rules questions and help things go smoothly. Most of the players there respect my knowledge of the game, and I provide relevant rules passages when necessary. I am also playing in the events, which are usually 8-person drafts. \n\nWe were in turns of the final round of a draft, the two players in last are the only ones still playing and on the last turn, but I've just finished dealing with turns for another match, so I'm on the other side of the room, I head over when I hear shouting coming from over there. Player 1, the non-active player has a history of raising his voice (he is in this case), and is often incorrect in rules interpretations (using silence as a counterspell, thinking counters get rid of a spells associated triggers, etc), player 2 is a slow player who plays the game at face level and doesn't necessarily understand all of the interactions. The story is, player 2 attacked, player 1 has no legal blockers or untapped mana - he says \"take x damage,\" player 2 responds with something verbal, the exact thing he said is unclear (player 1 insists it was \"yes\"), then after thinking a moment he plays a pump spell that will deal lethal damage. Player 1 insists that player 2 is now in the end of combat step or postcombat main, and that a pump spell won't increase the damage he takes. After hearing their stories I say that player 2 was acknowledging that player 1 was attempting to initiate a shortcut while he was doing the math, then ignored or interrupted that shortcut and played his spell before the damage step. I am partially taking into account that this is the last turn of the last game of the two lowest ranked players in the event, and that player 1 has literally no actions he could take at this point, no spells to cast or blockers to declare. I enter player 2 as the winner of that game (as opposed to draw).\n\nPlayer 1 just came up to me two weeks later and yelled at me for not knowing how the game works. I believe I was correct for a FNM level of rules enforcement, and that this interaction seems like it might come down to judges discretion. If my store does ever become part of the WPN I would like to be judge, so I do want to make sure that I interpreted things correctly and didn't have my judgement clouded. ",

        "text": "Hi, please take a moment to read and vote! I think this warrents a deep dive.\n\nI've been in debate with some other users around the ruling of cards like Gitaxian probe in EDH. Gitaxian probe reads:\n\n>Look at target player's hand. Draw a card.\n\nWhat i'm wondering is what your ruling on \"*Look at target player's hand*\" means in multiplayer... weather it means you just get to look (and can then say what you saw to other players), or if you get to physically reveal the cards to the whole table (or specific players).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The rules that seem to govern this in the Comprehensive Rules are:**\n\n>701.16. Reveal  \n>  \n>\\- 701.16a To reveal a card, show that card to all players for a brief time...  \n>  \n>\\- 701.16d Some effects instruct a player to look at one or more cards. Looking at a card follows the same rules as revealing a card, except that the card is shown only to the specified player.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And the ruling in the Tournament Rules (MTR) - 3.13 Hidden Information:**\n\n>Hidden information refers to the faces of cards and other objects at which the rules of the game and format do not allow you to look.  \n>  \n>Throughout the match, a draft, and pregame procedures, players are responsible for keeping their cards above the level of the playing surface and for making reasonable efforts to prevent hidden information from being revealed. **However, players may choose to reveal their hands or any other hidden information available to them, unless specifically prohibited by the rules.** Players must not actively attempt to gain information hidden from them, but are not required to inform opponents who are accidentally revealing hidden information.  \n>  \n>And a note on 3.13 on the Judge Resource page: \"*Players can show their opponent any information that that player is allowed to see.\"*\n\nMy understanding is that if I cast GitProbe in EDH, I get to look at the players hand, can take notes, and can say (truth or lie) what cards I saw to the other players. I can't physically reveal the cards in the players hand to the whole table (if they even physically give me their hand).\n\nWhat others have argued is that MTR 3.13 gives them the ability to reveal the hand to everyone, as it's \"hidden information that is available to them.\n\n**So that's the question,** what do you think? and what would your professional ruling be?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\n**More background on my reasoning:**\n\n* The comprehensive rule 701.16d only makes sense to exist to clarify that 'Reveal' and 'Look At' are distinct in multiplayer formats... where the distinction actually matters.\n* When Controlling a Player (a much more powerful action), you can't force the player to reveal their hand, unless a spell/ability (like Metalworker) facilitates it.\n* The interpretation that reveal=look at in multiplayer would mean that WoTC cound't use them to balance cards for EDH.\n* That comprehensive rule 701.16 is what MTG 3.13 means when it states *\"However, players may choose to reveal their hands or any other hidden information available to them,* ***unless specifically prohibited by the rules.\"***\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/18sov4d)",

        "text": "Hi judges, I am dipping my toes back into Comp REL and I know some things have changed since I last competed, however I had three calls at an RCQ today that seemed quite lenient, at least by old standards, and I wanted to get some other perspectives to find out if this is how things are adjudicated now or if my judge was personally choosing to be lenient.\n\nCall 1: Game 3 wraps up in an extremely close loss for me. Opponent cleans up his cards and realizes the planeswalker he was supposed to tuck on the bottom from a Subtlety is hiding under his lifepad. There was a lot of shuffling and revealing cards during this game, I being on Cascade and him on Creativity, and opponent says he intends to take the loss because he feels bad for not playing clean and leaving this now dead card out of his possible draws. We call a judge together. He receives a GRV and so do I even though I said I saw the card get tucked and there was an earlier graveyard check confirming it wasn't in there for some reason. Alright, not the worst in the world, but I am used to this being a game loss for the offending player and clearly so was opponent.\n\nCall 2: Opponent has a whole extra deck in his deckbox. While there aren't a ton of cards that could be substituted, I recall a time when having any amount of unregistered cards was a game loss. Opponent wasn't even given a warning. Fair enough, opponent did not appear to be cheating, but again just trying to get clarification here on how other people would handle it.\n\nCall 3: This is the biggest one. Game 3, opponent goes to grab a token and we discover a card from his mainboard sitting in with the tokens. He has played all of game 2 and several turns of game 3 without this card, which is bad against me, in his deck, presenting a 59 card deck in both games 2 and 3. Judge leaves it as a warning and suggests that opponent pile shuffle to count his cards next time. Card is shuffled back in and game is resumed. Presenting an illegal deck twice in a row used to be pretty serious; is that not the case any more or was this a personal decision on the judge's part? From what I see on the internet, presenting less than 60 cards is still supposed to be a game loss, but maybe I'm not checking the right place.\n\nTo anyone who reads and/or replies, thanks for your time and all that you do keep this great game going :) I just want to play a clean game and if this is how the rules have changed, fair enough and I'll adjust my expectations!",

If the number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of blockers is illegal. If a creature can’t block unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if blocking with that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature blocks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature blocks if able during each declare blockers step in that turn. If a requirement says that a creature must block during a turn, it must block during each declare blockers step in that turn.\n\nExample: A player controls one creature that “blocks if able” and another creature with no abilities. If a creature with menace attacks that player, the player must block with both creatures.

I *think* I know the answers, but I'd rather clear it up in my head before it becomes a problem when Omnath comes out.\n\nFirst question. Does one of these card's abilities take priority over the other, or would you stack the triggers in a way that you get to choose how the mana transforms? Meaning you stack them so that Omnath happens first, so it becomes black instead of colorless, and then since this a replacement effect for draining mana, Kruphix then wouldn't catch any of the mana draining.\n\nSecond question. Could you continually change the color of this mana as steps and phases end? So the abilities both state that the mana transforms instead of draining, but that wouldn't prevent it from *trying* to drain again at the end of future phases. So if all the mana was made to be colorless, could you then have it be caught again on a future trigger and change it all again to be black?\n\nMy guesses are that you choose how the triggers stack so it becomes the color of your choice upon its first draining attempt, and that you *can* change it from black to colorless as steps and phases end as you see fit.

To activate an ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an object's controller (or its owner, if it doesn't have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. **Activating an ability follows the steps listed below, in order. If, at any point during the activation of an ability, a player is unable to comply with any of those steps, the activation is illegal; the game returns to the moment before that ability started to be activated**. Announcements and payments can't be altered after they've been made.  \n- 602.2a. The player announces that they are activating the ability. If an activated ability is being activated from a hidden zone, the card that has that ability is revealed. That ability is created on the stack as an object that's not a card. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. Its controller is the player who activated the ability. The ability remains on the stack until it's countered, it resolves, or an effect moves it elsewhere.  \n- 602.2b. The remainder of the process for activating an ability is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules 601.2b-i. Those rules apply to activating an ability just as they apply to casting a spell. An activated ability's analog to a spell's mana cost (as referenced in rule 601.2f) is its activation cost.  \n- 601.2g. If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to activate mana abilities. Mana abilities must be activated before costs are paid.    \n- 601.2h. The player pays the total cost. First, they pay all costs that don't involve random elements or moving objects from the library to a public zone, in any order. Then they pay all remaining costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed. Unpayable costs can't be paid.  \n- 729.1. If a player takes an illegal action or starts to take an action but can't legally complete it, the entire action is reversed and any payments already made are canceled. No abilities trigger and no effects apply as a result of an undone action. If the action was casting a spell, the spell returns to the zone it came from. Each player may also reverse any legal mana abilities that player activated while making the illegal play, unless mana from those abilities or from any triggered mana abilities they caused to trigger was spent on another mana ability that wasn't reversed. Players may not reverse actions that moved cards to a library, moved cards from a library to any zone other than the stack, caused a library to be shuffled, or caused cards from a library to be revealed.",

The main reason I ask is that many people seem to want to put High Tide in their lists. However, if it works like #1 you'd have to cast all the cards at once and then resolve in reverse stack order and thus High Tide won't get a chance to resolve and give you the extra mana to cast more copied instants.

Stifle it)  \n- If no one responds, it starts to resolve.  \n- It creates a copy of each instant card in exile that you own with a kick counter on it.  \n- You are given permission to cast some, none, or all of those copies from exile (the copies, not the actual cards).  \n- You cast them now in whatever order you like, but you do have to pay the costs to cast them and you can use alternative costs casting them (eg. Overload, Fires of Invention, etc.).  \n- Once you've finished casting some, none or all of the copies, the trigger finishes resolving.  \n- Any card copies that you didn't cast go away, but you can get more next time Chun-Li attacks.\n- Any triggers that triggered on the casting of those spells (eg. Magecraft) now get put on the stack above all the spells you cast during the trigger.  \n- Players get priority to respond to any spells or triggers on the stack waiting to resolve.  \n  \nOnce all the spells and triggers resolve (one by one with priority passes after each), the game advances to the declare blockers step where the opponent can block (after a final priority pass).  \n  \nAlso, note Chun-Li can cast instants with kick counters put in exile by prior object instances of her, unlike a lot of other cards that have linked abilities.",

It's a treasure artifact with \"tap, sacrifice this artifact: add 1 mana of any color,  and it loses all other card types. \n\nSo my understanding is when a card says \"dies\" it is functionally a \"leaves the battlefield trigger\" replacement text. \n\nSo a couple things I want to check on if this works how I think it does. Please correct me if I'm wrong or provide an insight incase I need to explain it someone else.  \n\n1) If I have the enchantment Viridian Revel in play. When I sac one of these creatures turned into treasures it checks if it's an artifact as it's leaving the battlefield. Since its an artifact entering an opponents graveyard I would draw a card but the creature ceases being an artifact when in the graveyard.\n\n2) Say someone plays a volatile stormdrake. It either dies from not having the energy or if I later kill it. \n\nBecause Vraska's ability does not target, I would be able to bring to pay the one and return it as a treasure. \n\n3) The second thing I want to check in this scenario because it's checked what types it is as it leaves not while in the graveyard, if the \"treasure version\" of the drake gets exchanged for a creature and they sac it later because it's not a creature when it leaves I would not be able to pay 1 again to essentially keep stealing it correct? \n\n4) If I have the artifact kormus bell in play and urborg turning my opponents lands into swamps this combo turns all swamps into creatures. \n\nIf I were to kill any of these lands while they are creatures. I believe I would be able to pay the 1 and steal the land and it would cease to be a land but become a treasure. Would I still be able to tap that new treasure land for mana as if it were a land? I'm not sure if tapping it for mana is considered an ability it would retain once it becomes a treasure. Does it loses that ability once it is no longer has the land type? \n\nThe way those 2019 secret rare lands with all the text reads it makes me believe it loses that ability and can only sacrifice like a treasure for lands?",

When it enters, you get the option to exchange it with some other creature. If you do, you gain 4 Energy, then have to sacrifice the creature you just stole unless you pay an amount of Energy equal to the stolen creature's mana value. But regardless, yes, Vraska's ability does not target, and even if it did, it is going after a card in the Graveyard, and abilities like Shroud, Hexproof, and Ward only work while on the Battlefield.\n\n3) Correct. When something taken by Vraksa, it stops being a creature, so you canxt bring it back when you sacrifice it as a Treasure (unless you somehow animate the Treasure).\n\n4) Your suspicion is correct. See rule 305.6. The basic land types have the intrinsic ability to tap for the appropriate color of mana only if they are on a land. They don't need the Basic supertype for this to work, though.",

Specifically:\n\n> 702.21a Ward is a triggered ability. Ward [cost] means “Whenever this permanent becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, counter that spell or ability unless that player pays [cost].”\n\n.\n\n> Is there a place we we can understand things such as 'the beginning of the next end step' or 'until end of turn'? It is hard for us to understsnd how long spells or abilities last for...\n\nThe basic rulebook has a section on the steps of the turn which could be useful. Here's a link: https://magic.wizards.com/en/how-to-play#turn\n\nIn summary though, the end of the turn has two steps to it: the \"end step\" and the \"cleanup step\". The end step is where an \"at the begining of the next end step\" ability will trigger, and then everyone gets a chance to respond. The cleanup step is where \"Until end of turn\" durations will end and normally it's not possible to play anything in the cleanup step.\n\n> In terms of blocking, we get the general idea, but recently we discovered that we can also block an single attacking creature with two creatures. However, the attacker can then choose the order to which these are dealt. Can anyone help me with this?\n\nYes, that's correct. First, the attacking player picks which creatures will attack. Then the defending player picks which creatures will block, and what they are blocking. Then if 2 or more creatures are assigned to block the same attacker, the attacking player chooses a damage assignment order. Ie, they say \"I'll be killing this one first, then this one\". \n\nLater, in the combat damage step, the attacking player assigns damage equal to the attacking creature's power to the blockers. They have a bit of wiggle room about how to split up the damage, but if they want to assign any damage to the second creature, they must first assign lethal damage to the first creature.\n\nNote: the damage assignment order is just restricting what combinations of damage are legal, not changing when the damage is dealt. All the damage is dealt simultaneously. In other words, the point is to lock in roughly what you intend to do, so your opponent can make intelligent choices of how to respond (eg, which creature to cast their [giant growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=670768) on)\n\n> In relation to number 4, imagine if the attacker has first strike against two blockers. Does it apply only once, or does it apply twice to each of the two blockers?\n\nWhen first strike is involved, there are two combat damage steps. The creature with first strike will deal its damage (all of it) in the first of those steps. Any surviving creatures that lack first strike will deal their damage in the second of those steps.",

In detail:\n\nMost triggered abilities consider the gamestate immediately *after* the event takes place to figure out if they trigger. But there's a exception in the rules that \"leaves the battlefield\" abilities trigger based on the gamestate immediately *before* the event. \n\nAtla's ability is one example of a leaves-the-battlefield ability. Immediately before the destruction, atla is on the battlefield, so it's ability triggers. \n\nBut the words \"from anywhere\" cause Sefris to be inelligible for the exception. Thus the game checks immediately after the destruction, when sefris is not on the battlefield. Since it's not on the battlefield, it's ability does not trigger.\n\n> 603.10. **Normally, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked to see if the event matched any trigger conditions**, and continuous effects that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger conditions are and what the objects involved in the event look like. However, some triggered abilities are exceptions to this rule; the game “looks back in time” to determine if those abilities trigger, using the existence of those abilities and the appearance of objects immediately prior to the event. **The list of exceptions is as follows**:\n\n>603.10a **Some zone-change triggers look back in time. These are leaves-the-battlefield abilities**, abilities that trigger when a card leaves a graveyard, and abilities that trigger when an object that all players can see is put into a hand or library. Example: Two creatures are on the battlefield along with an artifact that has the ability “Whenever a creature dies, you gain 1 life.” Someone casts a spell that destroys all artifacts, creatures, and enchantments. The artifact’s ability triggers twice, even though the artifact goes to its owner’s graveyard at the same time as the creatures.\n\n>603.6c Leaves-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent moves from the battlefield to another zone, or when a phased-in permanent leaves the game because its owner leaves the game. These are written as, but aren’t limited to, “When \\[this object\\] leaves the battlefield, . . .” or “Whenever \\[something\\] is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, . . . .” (See also rule 603.10.) An ability that attempts to do something to the card that left the battlefield checks for it only in the first zone that it went to. **An ability that triggers when a card is put into a certain zone “from anywhere” is never treated as a leaves-the-battlefield ability, even if an object is put into that zone from the battlefield.**\n\n(emphasis added)",

        "text": "So I was stumbling through old SCG matches and I found this match with Patrick Sullivan in it from 2011 and decided to watch it as I am a big Patrick Sullivan fan. He of course is playing Mono Red against Caw Blade, and in game 1 Patrick resolves a Koth of the Hammer, activates his +1 ability to animate a mountain and attack with it for 4. A few turns later, Patrick draws a second Koth of the Hammer, and takes the line of using the first Koth to turn a mountain into a 4/4, cast a new Koth, use that one to animate a second land into a 4/4 to force his opponent to chump block with both of his creatures, which I thought was a pretty good line. However, as he casts the second Koth and goes to activate it, there is a pause and the commentators say \"That's not how planeswalkers work. Sullivan using old legend rule, it hasn't worked that way since 2003.\" The result of this is that both of his Koths end up in the graveyard. Now I was really confused, as I didn't play magic back then, and the line that Patrick attempted to take would work in current rules and would've put him in a fantastic spot to win the game.\n\nSo my question is, what was the rule about planeswalkers that made Sullivan have to sacrifice both Koths, and what are the commentators refering to when they say \"2003\"? Video I'm referecing is here: [https://youtu.be/rDoxU8T8FI8?si=l6vNWxahKCDC20kp&t=494](https://youtu.be/rDoxU8T8FI8?si=l6vNWxahKCDC20kp&t=494) with the play in question at about 8:16)",

The bigger one is that before Magic 2014 the legend rule and planeswalker uniqueness rule sent all the applicable permanents to their owners' graveyards instead of letting you choose one to keep. \n\nSee this rule form the Dragon's Maze CR, the last one before the Magic 2014 CR:\n>**704.5j** If two or more planeswalkers that share a planeswalker type are on the battlefield, all are put into their owners' graveyards.

        "text": "Hello! I am looking for some insight into rules and potential rulings regarding a scenario with priority in a 4-player Commander game at FNM level.  So not full REL, but definitely trying to follow the rules as close as possible.\n\nPlayers, in turn order, are Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave; Alice is the current active player.\n\nAlice moves into her post-combat main phase, and is thinking over the cards in her hand.  Dave has on his battlefield, a \\[\\[Scavenging Ooze\\]\\], and 1 untapped Forest.  Dave says aloud to the pod, \"If I could please be told when I have priority, I have interaction I would like to use.\"\n\nAlice responds \"Sure, you can have priority.\"  No objections or responses from Bob or Charlie.  Dave uses his forest to activate the Scavenging Ooze, exiling a \\[\\[Bloodghast\\]\\] from Bob's graveyard.  No reponses from any player.  Bob assumes this was done on the endstep before he untaps for his next turn, and asks \"Okay, so I'll go to my turn now?\"  Alice says, \"No, I'm not done in my main phase.\"\n\nHere's the concern: Alice, as the active player, passed priority during her main phase when the stack was empty, which I have always assumed is implied that they want to move to the next step or phase of the turn.  When asked, Dave says it \"doesn't matter\" when he's activating the Ooze, just that it was before Bob's turn so he wouldn't get to return the Bloodghast.  Alice now wants to continue in her main phase to cast a \\[\\[Regrowth\\]\\] targeting a card in her graveyard, which, when asked, Dave admitted he would have probably tried to stop with the Scavenging Ooze's ability if he could.  Alice claims that she never said that she wanted to move to her endstep, all she meant was that Dave could have priority while she was still thinking about how she wanted to order her spells for the rest of her turn.  I think, but cannot prove, that this was angle-shooting by Alice, because her decisions were made easier by no longer needing to worry about the Ooze stopping her plans to use Regrowth.\n\nHow would be the best way to resolve this dispute?  Dave never said specifically when he was activating the Ooze, so to follow rule 117.4: **\"If all players pass in succession (that is, if all players pass without taking any actions in between passing), the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves or, if the stack is empty, the phase or step ends.\"**\n\nSo, if Dave activated the Ooze during the main phase, then we are still in the main phase, but, if Dave technically passed during the main phase to activate during the endstep, then they are in the endstep, right?  Does this mean that it is up to Dave to determine during what part of the turn it is?\n\nI would appreciate any insight people can give me! Thank you very much!",

Put a time counter on Out of Time for each creature phased out this way. Vanishing (At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter from this enchantment. When the last is removed, sacrifice it.) \n\nDotM is a sorcery that costs {X}{W}{U} and reads, \"Return up to X target artifact and/or non-Aura enchantment cards each with mana value X or less from your graveyard to the battlefield. If X is 6 or more, those permanents are 4/4 creatures in addition to their other types.\"\n\nWithin my play group, the player who pulls this combo off argues that when he plays DotM and returns OoT to the battlefield as a 4/4 creature (because he always pays enough mana to have X be 6 or more) that it phases out itself along with every other creature on the battlefield, and since it is phased out, if he leaves the game for whatever reason, that we (the players who get shafted by this combo) do not get our creatures back. The basis for this argument is that the condition of OoT is that they are all phased out \"until it leaves the battlefield\", and because it is phased out there is no way for the ability to check and see if it left the battlefield. \n\nHere's my thinking: if the player brings back Out of Time with Dance of the Manse with the X cost equaling 6, they would phase out all creatures on the field until Out of Time leaves the battlefield. The player getting eliminated would force all of their owned cards to leave the game and Out of Time's condition of it leaving the battlefield is met. Is this true? Please explain how this interaction works, and if I am correct.

It’s a 3/3 creature ...\"  \n  \nThe way I am reading this it works a lot like a manifest but it has power and toughness 3/3 (but unlike manifest, even if it were a creature you can't flip it over because it isn't a manifest). You note what spell you are choosing as it exists when targeted in the graveyard. Then you move the spell to the battlefield facedown and it becomes a 3/3 colorless creature with no creature type (just like a manifest as described before, but not a manifest obviously) and a couple of complicated abilities we will get to later.  \n  \n**Question 1:** What kinds of cards can be targeted with this ability? Obviously, Instants and Sorceries, as that is what is written on Magar, but what about Split Cards, Aftermath Cards, MDFCs, and Adventures?  \n\nMy guess is the following:  \n  >Split Cards - OK  \n  >Aftermath Cards - OK, but only the non-Aftermath half  \n  >MDFC's - OK, but only if the front of the card is an Instant or Sorcery    \n  >Adventures - No  \n  \n  \n**Question 2:** What conditions are noted about the named card? For example, is its location noted (relevant for Question 3)?  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \n**Question 3, Introduction:**  \nOkay now we get to the really confusing parts. When the 3/3 creature deals combat damage to a player, the control \"may create a copy of the card with the noted name.\" \n\n> \"... with “Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, you may create a copy of the card with the noted name. ...\"  \n  \nThe rules state the following about \"creating a copy of a card\" in 707.12  \n> 707.12. An effect that instructs a player to cast a copy of an object (and not just copy a spell) follows the rules for casting spells, except that the copy is created in the same zone the object is in and then cast while another spell or ability is resolving. Casting a copy of an object follows steps 601.2a–h of rule 601, “Casting Spells,” and then the copy becomes cast. Once cast, the copy is a spell on the stack, and just like any other spell it can resolve or be countered.  \n  \nAdditional relevant information is here:  \n> 707.14. One card (Magar of the Magic Strings) instructs a player to note the name of a particular card in a graveyard and create a copy of the card with the noted name. To do so, use the characteristics of that card as it last existed in the graveyard to determine the copiable values of the copy. (See rule 608.2h.)  \n  \n> 608.2h If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures on the battlefield), the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied. If the effect requires information from a specific object, including the source of the ability itself, the effect uses the current information of that object if it’s in the public zone it was expected to be in; if it’s no longer in that zone, or if the effect has moved it from a public zone to a hidden zone, the effect uses the object’s last known information. See rule 113.7a. If an ability states that an object does something, it’s the object as it exists—or as it most recently existed—that does it, not the ability.  \n  \nand  \n> 113.7a Once activated or triggered, an ability exists on the stack independently of its source. Destruction or removal of the source after that time won’t affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to do something (for example, “Prodigal Pyromancer deals 1 damage to any target”) rather than the ability doing anything directly. In these cases, any activated or triggered ability that references information about the source for use while announcing an activated ability or putting a triggered ability on the stack checks that information when the ability is put onto the stack. Otherwise, it will check that information when it resolves. In both instances, if the source is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at that time, its last known information is used. The source can still perform the action even though it no longer exists.  \nif relevant.  \n  \n**Question 3:** Where does this copy of \"the card noted\" get created?

I think the relevant rulings can be found in 709, 707, and 601 but I'm not sure how they fit together. \n\n**709.4.** In every zone except the stack, the characteristics of a split card are those of its two halves combined. \n\nThis rule clearly allows you to exile Said//Done with Chun Li. Because Done is an Instant, Said//Done is an instant. So the question becomes, can you choose Said when casting Said//Done and if you can choose it can you cast it?\n\n **709.3.** A player chooses which half of a split card they are casting before putting it onto the stack.   \n **709.3c** An effect may create a copy of a split card and allow a player to cast the copy. That copy retains the characteristics of the two halves separated into the same two halves as the original card. (See rule 707.12.)\n\nI *believe* this means that you could choose Said when casting Said//Done from exile. \n\nAssuming that is true, the last question would be about timing. This part I'm completely unsure about. Since she's copying the spell then trying to cast the copy, would a copy of a sorcery be castable? A similar effect is the trigger from Dreadhorde Arcanist, but its got some notable differences.

Similarly, a spell may require alternative targets only if an alternative or additional cost was chosen for it. If the spell has a variable number of targets, the player announces how many targets they will choose before they announce those targets. In some cases, the number of targets will be defined by the spell’s text.

However, if the spell uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as a target, the player chooses targets so that they obey the maximum possible number of such effects without violating any rules or effects that say that an object or player can’t be chosen as a target. The chosen objects and/or players each become a target of that spell.
